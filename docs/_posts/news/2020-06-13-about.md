Welcome to <b>cdb</b>, the container database software that will help you to create a simple
data container! This interface will give you a little background on the project.

### What is a Data Container?

A data container is generally an operating-system-less container that is optimized
to provide data, either for query/search, or binding for analysis. The qualities of
the data container should be:

 1. It can be mounted to containers with operating systems to run analysis
 2. It can be interacted with on it's own to search metadata about the data
 3. It should not have an operating system.

### How do we generate one?

The generation is fairly simple! It comes down to a three step multistage build:

 1. **Step 1** We install [cdb](https://github.com/vsoch/cdb) to generate a GoLang template for an [in-memory database](https://github.com/vsoch/containerdb) for our data) 
 2. **Step 2** We compile the binary into an entrypoint
 3. **Step 3** We add the data and the binary entrypoint to a scratch container (no operating system).

And then we interact with it! This tutorial will show you the basic steps to
perform the multistage-build using a simple [Dockerfile](https://github.com/vsoch/cdb/tree/master/examples/docker-simple/Dockerfile) along with the data folder. The [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) in the base of the repository also is a good example.
